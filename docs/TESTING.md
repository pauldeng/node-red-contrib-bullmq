# Testing

## Fast Local Tests

```sh
npm test
```

This runs built-in `node:test` suites for package metadata, connection normalization, scheduler compatibility, command dispatch, editor surface, registration, Docker fixture contracts, docs, and examples.

## Node-RED Runtime Tests

Use `node-red-node-test-helper` for flow-level tests. Runtime coverage should load actual Node-RED flows for:

- `bull cmd` success and failure paths;
- `bull run` immediate and manual modes;
- `bull job` acknowledgement actions;
- `bull events`;
- `bull flow`;
- legacy flow compatibility.

The current standalone Redis integration suite is opt-in:

```sh
npm run test:integration
```

It starts a temporary local `redis-server`, loads real Node-RED flows, and verifies:

- `bull cmd` add/run behavior;
- manual `bull run` acknowledgement through `bull job`;
- legacy repeat scheduler creation, lookup, and removal;
- delayed-job commands;
- priority listing and counts;
- global rate-limit commands;
- deduplication commands and `bull events` delivery;
- `bull flow` parent/child FlowProducer output.

## Playwright

Editor changes require Playwright coverage:

```sh
npm run test:playwright
```

Cover deployment field visibility, credential persistence, TLS fields, and edit dialogs for all node types.

## Docker Matrix

Use Docker for the topology matrix:

```sh
npm run test:deployments
```

The runner starts each fixture, waits for Redis readiness, runs `test/integration-deployment.test.js`, and removes volumes between deployments.

Current executable fixtures:

- `single-noauth`: standalone Redis without auth or TLS
- `single-auth`: standalone Redis with ACL auth
- `single-tls`: standalone Redis with TLS
- `cluster-auth`: two-node Redis Cluster with ACL auth and BullMQ `{bull}` prefix coverage
- `cluster-tls`: two-node Redis Cluster with TLS and BullMQ `{bull}` prefix coverage
- `sentinel-auth`: Redis master, two replicas, and three Sentinels with data-node ACL auth
- `sentinel-tls`: Redis master, two replicas, and three TLS-enabled Sentinels

The shared deployment test proves Node-RED load, connection, add/run delivery, required `basecasts` scheduler creation/removal, and absolute scheduler minute/second metadata. TLS fixtures use local self-signed test certificates and disable certificate verification for those Docker-only deployments. MemoryDB remains the certificate-verified TLS deployment path.

## AWS MemoryDB

MemoryDB tests are opt-in. Use environment variables only:

- `MEMORYDB_ENDPOINT`
- `MEMORYDB_PORT`
- `MEMORYDB_USERNAME`
- `MEMORYDB_PASSWORD`
- optional `MEMORYDB_TLS`
- explicit enable flag such as `MEMORYDB_ENABLED=1`

Run MemoryDB with the same deployment harness:

```sh
MEMORYDB_ENABLED=1 npm run test:deployments
```

Never write these values to repository files, examples, fixtures, snapshots, or logs.
